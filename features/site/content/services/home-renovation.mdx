faqs:
  - question: "Can I consult you before buying land or property?"
    answer: "Yes. We offer a pre-purchase consultation where we review title and zoning, check flood/soil risks, estimate build/renovation costs, and outline permit timelines and ROI. You'll receive a short report with risks, options, and a budget range so you can decide confidently."
  - question: "Are your services available outside the city?"
    answer: "Yes. We work across most districts and can handle projects outside the city. Remote feasibility checks are available, and on-site visits beyond a 30 km radius may include a travel fee. Availability and timelines depend on local permitting—tell us the location and we'll confirm."
  - question: "Do you manage properties for landlords or investors?"
    answer: "Yes. We provide end-to-end property management: marketing and tenant screening, lease drafting, rent collection, maintenance coordination, periodic inspections, and monthly statements. Fees vary by property type and city; portfolio pricing is available."
